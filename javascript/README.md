# JavaScript
## Design Patterns in Modern JavaScript:
### Plain Old JavaScript Objects and Object Constructors

#### Object Literals
> One of the simplest ways to organize code is by grouping things into objects
#### Object Constructors
> Cleaner way to create Objects by using Constructors
A constructor is a function used for initializing new objects, and you use the new keyword to call the constructor.
#### The Prototype
> All JavaScript objects have a prototype. A prototype is another object that the original object inherits from (access to all prototype's methods and properties)

### Factory Functions and the Module Pattern
### Classes
### ES6 Modules
